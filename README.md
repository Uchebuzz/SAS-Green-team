# Dynamic Impact of waste Generation

This was our submission for the SAS Curiosity Cup 2023.
Waste generation has exponentially increased and is increasingly becoming a critical issue bothering the countries and the world at large,
In this report, our team sourced 2 datasets; A World Bank dataset from Kaggle and OECD Waste data. We conducted exploratory data analysis, clustering and forensic forecasting, we examined the trends on primarily food waste generation over time. 

We used two datasets which you can find on the repo as well
