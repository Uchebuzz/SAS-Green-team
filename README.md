# Dynamic Impact of waste Generation

This was our submission for the SAS Curiosity Cup 2023.
Waste generation has exponentially increased and is increasingly becoming a critical issue bothering the countries and the world at large,
In this report, our team sourced 2 datasets; A World Bank dataset from Kaggle and OECD Waste data. We conducted exploratory data analysis, clustering and forensic forecasting, we examined the trends on primarily food waste generation over time. 

## Structure of the Repository
### Dataset
Two datasets were used in this project:
- `Countries`: This contains the countries gdp, population, and area code(For Map visualisation SAS)
- `FOOD_WASTE_csvformat`: This conatined the food waste metric per country
The two datasets were carefully joined see `JOIN` to see our process of Joining


### EDA 
You can find our work process and Eda `SAS_Team(1)`


### Final Report
Our report can be found  `Dynamic impact of Food waste in the world`
